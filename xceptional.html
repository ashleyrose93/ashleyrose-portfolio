box-1-text: <a href="https://xceptional.io">Xceptional</a> recognises, celebrates and harnesses the unique strengths of people with autism and channels  these skills into business technology challenges that call for a different solution.
box-2-title: Role
box-2-text: I worked with Xceptional during my time at Filtered Media as Graphic Designer + Storyteller. The following digital eBooks were designed as <a href="https://xceptional.io/resources/">downloadable resources</a> for Xceptional's website. With a very strong visual style already established for the website, these resources were designed to reflect the same style and belong to the existing brand.
