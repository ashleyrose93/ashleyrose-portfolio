box-1-title: Overview
box-1-text: The statistics are shocking. Every year, over 500 billion takeaway cups pile up in landfill. Until now, the only attempt to solve this issue has been reusable cups designed for the end consumer. While this helps coffee drinkers ’do their bit’, individually owned cups are not the scalable solution needed to solve this global problem. <a href="https://huskee.co/">Huskee</a> are the brains behind HuskeeCup, a reusable coffee cup made from raw coffee husk.
box-2-title: Role
box-2-text: I worked with Huskee during my time at Filtered Media as Graphic Designer + Storyteller. This pitch deck was created to showcase their revolutionary initiatives and help secure funding to solve a global environmental issue.
