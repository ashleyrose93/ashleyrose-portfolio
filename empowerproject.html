box-1-title: Overview
box-1-text: Empower Project is a conference event designed to inform consumers of local social enterprise in Auckland, and empower them to shop more ethically. The event hosts a range of speakers who tell their story of owning a social enterprise and how they plan on changing the world. The intent is to inspire consumers to think about where their money is really going, and how they can help make changes they want to see in the world. This is a hypothetical event, Empower Project was my graduate project during studies.
box-2-title: Project process
box-2-text: I envisioned Empower Project during my studies at Media Design School. For this project I interviewed local social enterprise business owners, and researched the changing landscape of doing business for good. Collateral included branding, print booklets, a website and lanyards.
